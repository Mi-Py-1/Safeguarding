Introduction

The Safeguarding Guide is my first project as part of the Code Institute Full Stack Development for the AI Augmented Developer 16 week Bootcamp. It is designed as an unassessed project over 3 days to enable me to demonstrate what I have learned in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and AI in the first 5 weeks of the course.
