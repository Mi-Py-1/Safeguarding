Introduction

The Safeguarding Guide is my first project as part of the Code Institute Full Stack Development for the AI Augmented Developer 16 week Bootcamp. It is designed as an unassessed project over 3 days to enable me to demonstrate what I have learned in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and AI in the first 5 weeks of the course.

Project Outline:

<br>

The Safeguarding Guide is a fictional organisation who's objective is to provide upto date information to both professionals and members of the public and will cover adults, children and animals. They will also provide training and community outreach. 

The final deliverable will showcase aspects of my learning from the last 5 weeks in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and AI support. It is important that the correct design choices are made for this to ensure that the site is responsive to modern devices, adheres to accessibility requirements and is aesthetically pleasing for a user to navigate. 

Key Objectives:




UX Design

User Stories

Colours

<br>

The colour was chosen based on the main hero image. This was to ensure all aspects could be pulled together pleasingly. I used coolors.co to generate a pallet out of the image and checked these with Colour Contrast Checker.

Main Pallet:

--white: #ffffff; text
--midnight-green: #1A4B56; background
--orange-peel: #F89900; highlight / hover

Fonts:

The font was chosen with google fonts. The font is Sour Gummy:

@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Sour+Gummy:ital,wght@0,100..900;1,100..900&display=swap');

WireFrames:

Wireframes have been drawn up on paper and images will be added to readme later.

Images:

Images have been taken from freepik. The hero image was generated by Dall-E 3 AI now part of ChatGPT. This required several iterations to create something that fitted the needs ot he Hero image. 

Images taken to be visually pleasing and reflect brand but to avoid being distressing or triggering. Images must also promote inclusivity and avoid stereotypes.  


Features: 

Navbar: I added a navbar using bootstrap and then styled this. I added a font awesome icon to make the website name appear more appealing and filled in some of the expected links. I styled the navbar using the pallete colors and included a "contact me" button to link to a later contact page and form.

Footer: I added a basic navbar and included the font awesome icon to base the other information around. I added another "contact me" button and included some links for policy and copywrite information. I styled these and used copilot to support spacing.
