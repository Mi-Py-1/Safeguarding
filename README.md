Introduction

The Safeguarding Guide is my first project as part of the Code Institute Full Stack Development for the AI Augmented Developer 16 week Bootcamp. It is designed as an unassessed project over 3 days to enable me to demonstrate what I have learned in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and AI in the first 5 weeks of the course.

Project Outline:

The Safeguarding Guide is a fictional organisation who's objective is to provide upto date information to both professionals and members of the public and will cover adults, children and animals. They will also provide training and community outreach. 

The final deliverable will showcase aspects of my learning from the last 5 weeks in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and AI support. It is important that the correct design choices are made for this to ensure that the site is responsive to modern devices, adheres to accessibility requirements and is aesthetically pleasing for a user to navigate.
